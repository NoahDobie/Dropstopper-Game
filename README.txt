This code is a simple game called "Dropstopper", where the player must press the number on the keyboard that matches the number that is falling on the screen before it reaches the bottom. The gameboard is represented by a 2D array of characters, and the game's state is stored in various variables such as score, lives, ypos, and randomNum. The code uses the Windows API function "system()" to set the console mode, clear the screen, and change the console title. The game's main loop is implemented using a while loop, and the game's speed increases as the player's score increases. The code also uses the C library function "srand()" to seed the random number generator, and the "clock()" function to control the timing of the game's updates.

It's really simple and straightforward, just download and play!

Extract zip file, and put folder in a good location

Best to play using the .exe file as using in console doesn't work great (designed for windows cmd)

Folder is needed to keep track of highscores as a textfile is created!
